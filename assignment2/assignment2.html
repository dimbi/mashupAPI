      <h2>Think & Post - idea(s) for Assignment #1</h2><br>

      <p>this should include at minimum a paragraph description of what I'm thinking about doing, how the data flow might work, and what the experience of a user visiting the site would be like.</p>

      <h2>3 code exercises</h2><br>

      <h3>Looping Triangle</h3>
        <p>Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output "#".</p>
        <script src="js/looptriangle.js"></script><br>

      <h3>Fizz Buzz</h3>
        <p>Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.</p>
        <script src="js/fizzbuzz.js"></script><br>


      <h3>Chessboard</h3>
        <p>Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should form a chess board.</p>
