,Jurassic Park,The Lost World: Jurassic Park,Jurassic Park III,Jurassic World,Jurassic Park,The Lost World,,1993,1997,2001,2015,1990,1995,Tyrannosaurus rex,,,,,,,"One of the most famous dinosaurs in Jurassic Park series, theTyrannosaurus rex was portrayed very true to its real counterpart, such as in the second film, being parents to its offspring. In the third film, a young male only made an appearance eating and then fought with the Spinosaurus only to be killed by it. In the first film, the T. rex is 40 feet (12 m) long, 13 feet (4.0 m) at the hips and weighs 17,500 pounds (7,900 kg), about 50 percent heavier than an African elephant. The female Tyrannosaurs rex are cinnamon with grey stripes on the head and tail and the males are jade green with dark green stripes on its nose, back, legs and tail. InJurassic World, the Tyrannosaurus played a part in defeating theIndominus rex."Velociraptor,,,,,,,"In all of the Jurassic Park films, the Velociraptor was one of the most commonly seen dinosaurs on the islands. They were portrayed to be the most intelligent and one of the most vicious of all the dinosaurs throughout the film series. In all of the films, the characters referred to the Velociraptor simply as ""raptors"". The films also depict Velociraptor as significantly larger than its actual size (2' tall, 6-7' long). In the beginning of the film, Alan Grant discovers a fossil he estimates at about 6' tall and 9' long, and the raptors in the park are roughly that size. Actually, the dinosaurs portrayed in the film as ""Velociraptors"" are almost identical to the real life Deinonychus, which is another genus. It is speculated that this incorrect portrayal came about because of mislabelling ofDeinonychus as a subspecies of Velociraptor in the 1988 American book, Predatory Dinosaurs of the World, whose author, Gregory Paul, is credited as an inspiration by Crichton at the end of his first novel. In Jurassic World, Owen Grady was the trainer of a small pack of Velociraptors, which temporarily fell under the control of Indominus rex. These Velociraptors also played a part in the defeat of Indominus rex."Triceratops,,,,,,,"Although it has always been a popular dinosaur, the Triceratopsdid not really have any major roles after the first film. In the first film, it was found sick and was being cared for by Ellie Sattler (portrayed by Laura Dern) and Dr.Harding. In The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Triceratops was captured by InGen-hired hunters, and was later released, demolishing the hunters' tents. In Jurassic Park III a herd of Triceratops is seen very briefly in the flyby scene with the other herds."Stegosaurus,,,,,,,"A group of Stegosaurus saw Sarah taking some pictures of a babyStegosaurus and believed that she was trying to harm it and charged. The Stegosaurus were also a victim of the dinosaur hunters, but along with all of the others were eventually released. The name ""Stegasaurus"" (a typo, obviously), was seen next to a vial in the Cold Storage Room scene in Jurassic Park."Parasaurolophus,,,,,,,"These dinosaurs are seen in each movie. In Jurassic Park, they are seen along with Brachiosaurus feeding near a pond. In The Lost World: Jurassic Park, Parasaurolophus were captured by the dinosaur hunters but were freed along with the others. In Jurassic Park III, they were seen along with Corythosaurus."Gallimimus,,,,,,,"When Hammond's grandchildren and Alan Grant were running out onto a plain, a herd of Gallimimus were startled and one was killed by a T. rex."Brachiosaurus,,,,,,,"The Brachiosaurus was the first dinosaur to ever appear in the film (with the exception of the Velociraptor in the beginning) in whatEmpire called the 28th most magical moment in cinema. They were first seen feeding on tree branches and swimming in the rivers. They are later seen when Alan and the kids spend the night in a tree. They were shown only briefly in the third film. In the first novel, Apatosaurus appears instead of Brachiosaurus, and in one chapter Tim incorrectly comments to himself, in response to a comment about the latter's size, that Brachiosaurus is three times larger than Apatosaurus."Dilophosaurus,,,,,,,"Dilophosaurus was supposed to be part of the first park tour inJurassic Park, but was not seen. When Dennis Nedry was trying to fix his Jeep and got stuck in the mud, he was savagely blinded and killed by a Dilophosaurus. While the film's Dilophosaurus was too small and had a fleshy frill around its neck as well as being poisonous, the novel's Dilophosaurus is correctly sized and lacks the frill. Dilophosaurus can be seen in the second film on the computer display inside the trailer. It can be also seen on a chart in the abandoned lab in the third film along with several other dinosaurs. Dilophosaurus makes two brief appearances inJurassic World, as a hologram in the Visitor's Center and being mentioned in a sequence in which its venom paralyzes Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon."Compsognathus,,,,,,,"These small dinosaurs make a brief appearance in the second film, in which a pack of several Compsognathus killed Dieter Stark in The Lost World."Pteranodon,,,,,,,"At the very end of The Lost World, several are shown flying above the Stegosaurus herd and in the sky while one of them is shown briefly up close. Their most notable appearance was in Jurassic Park III, when Dr. Alan Grant and the others went into the bird cage where they were attacked by them. They also make a more notable appearance in Jurassic World, when they are freed from their containment by Indominus rex and soon wreck havoc on the tourists."Pachycephalosaurus,,,,,,,"In The Lost World a group of dinosaur hunters were trying to capture one of these, but when the other dinosaurs are freed, thePachycephalosaurus charges at the hunters."Spinosaurus,,,,,,,"Jurassic Park III scientific advisor, Jack Horner, decided to retireT. rex after its appearance in the previous two films, and broughtSpinosaurus into the franchise for the third film. In this film, theSpinosaurus along with the Velociraptor (again) is the main antagonist, and is portrayed to be 50 feet (15 m) long, 16 feet (4.9 m) at the hips [excluding its fin] and weighing 12 tonnes (12,000 kg)."Ankylosaurus,,,,,,,"These dinosaurs are briefly seen in Jurassic Park III, but do not act as any main dinosaurs in the film. In Jurassic World, fourAnkylosaurus are chased by the Indominus rex when they are encountered by Gray and Zach in the Gyrosphere, and one of them is killed by Indominus."Corythosaurus,,,,,,,"Corythosaurus, misnamed Carinthasaurus, is seen in Roland Tembo's field guide packet. Corythosaurus is seen in Jurassic Park III as a herd along with Parasaurolophus when the characters are running through the pasture."Ceratosaurus,,,,,,,"While Alan and the rest of the team are digging for Kirby's phone in the Spinosaurus dung, a Ceratosarus can be seen walking by, and doesn't like the smell of the dung."Mamenchisaurus,,,,,,,A Mamenchisaurus was seen in a herd in The Lost World where the hunters started hunting.Apatosaurus,,,,,,,"The first dinosaurs seen on the island. It is replaced byBrachiosaurus in the first film and by Mamenchisaurus in the second. In The Lost World: Jurassic Park film, there are the bones, primarily vertebrae, of Apatosaurs seen in the Velociraptornest, and Ian, Kelly and Sarah pass a carcass of an Apatosauruson their way into the Worker Village. Apatosaurus made an appearance in Jurassic World, when several injured specimens are encountered by Owen and Claire after being attacked byIndominus."Dimorphodon,,,,,,,Dimorphodon was revealed to be an attraction in Jurassic Worldon a leaked brochure image. They are located in the aviary alongside Pteranodon.Mosasaurus,,,,,,,"Mosasaurus inhabits a lagoon in the Jurassic World theme park, where it features its own attraction, the ""Mosasaurus Feeding Show"" "" in which it is fed great white sharks. The Mosasaurusplayed a part in the defeat of Indominus rex, where it dragged it into the lagoon after it was cornered by Tyrannosaurus rex and aVelociraptor."Indominus rex,,,,,,,"Indominus rex is a new, genetically modified hybrid mutant dinosaur to appear as an main antagonist in Jurassic World. It is said to be a hybrid created from the DNA of Tyrannosaurus,Giganotosaurus, Rugops, Majungasaurus, and Carnotaurus.[2]Jurassic World also reveals her genetic composition includes traces of Velociraptor, tree frogs and cuttlefish, which resulted in various innate abilities from said animals - the raptors' intelligence, the amphibians' thermal adaptability, and the cuttlefish'scamouflage.[3] The Indominus rex has killed her sibling and has been hunting other dinosaurs for sport. It also has the ability to communicate with and control Velociraptors to some extent due to the fact that it shares their DNA. The ""Indominus rex"" is known to be larger than a Tyrannosaurus rex, designed to be up to 50 feet when fully grown."Procompsognathus,,,,,,,"Plays the same role in the novels that Compsognathus does in the films, they are revealed to be mildly venomous and kill John Hammond at the end of the first novel."Camarasaurus,,,,,,,Replaces Apatosaurus in some editions of the first novel.Maiasaura,,,,,,,"When Alan Grant and the kids are taking a nap, they discover aMaiasaura feeding near them and accidentally frighten it away."Dryosaurus,,,,,,,"These are on the tour, and are one of the first dinosaurs seen after the Procompsognathus, the Velociraptor, and the Apatosaurus.

They dive-bomb Dr. Grant and the kids when they enter the aviary."Carnotaurus,,,,,,,"An odd dinosaur with very little importance, save only that at the beginning of The Lost World a pair of them attack Richard Levine and kill his guide. They are also capable of changing skin color like a chameleon. The pair is also seen again later when the characters are at the abandoned gas station."Othnielia,,,,,,,"These small dinosaurs are referred to as ""Othys"", and are found in the trees."Ornitholestes,,,,,,,"Levine examined a beached ""aberrant form"". He was not able to make a precise identification, but his best guess is that it was anOrnitholestes. However, due to the fact that chromatophores were discovered in a skin sample of the specimen, it is likely that it was instead a Carnotaurus, unless Crichton's Ornitholestes, too, would have had the fictional camouflage ability."Mussaurus,,,,,,,"Only seen once, just before Levine and his guide are ambushed by Carnotaurus."Hadrosaurus,,,,,,,A herd of these stampeded when attacked by the Tyrannosaurus.Microceratus,,,,,,,Appears in the first book were it is referred to as Microceratops.Microceratus was revealed to be an attraction in Jurassic Worldfrom an image on the film's official website.Callovosaurus,,,,,,,Replaces Microceratus in some editions of the first novel.Metriacanthosaurus,,,,,,,"Metriacanthosaurus is not seen in the movies, but its name can be seen next to a vial in the Cold Storage Room, and on the map of the park. At that time, Yangchuanosaurus was classified as a species of Metriacanthosaurus, so the dinosaur on the vial could refer to Metriacanthosaurus or Yangchuanosaurus."Proceratosaurus,,,,,,,"Its name is seen in the second embryo cold storage vial, though never witnessed on the tour."Segisaurus,,,,,,,"Segisaurus' name was seen briefly on a map of Isla Nublar, but it was never seen."Herrerasaurus,,,,,,,"Herrerasaurus is not seen in the Jurassic Park movies, but its name is on a map inside of the Jeep's brochure in Jurassic Park."Suchomimus,,,,,,,"Suchomimus is mentioned by Billy while trying to identify the predator which attacked them, which was a Spinosaurus.Suchomimus was revealed to be an attraction in Jurassic Worldfrom an image on the film's official website."Baryonyx,,,,,,,Baryonyx is mentioned by Billy while trying to identify the predator which attacked them (a Spinosaurus). It was also seen on the map of Isla Nublar. Baryonyx was revealed to be an attraction inJurassic World from an image on the films official website.Ultrasaurus,,,,,,,"Mentioned by Tim as being bigger than Apatosaurus. Likely refers to the chimera ""Ultrasauros"", which is often misspelled ""Ultrasaurus"" (which actually refers to a much smaller Korean sauropod)."Seismosaurus,,,,,,,"Mentioned by Tim as being bigger than Apatosaurus. It is now known that ""Seismosaurus"" is not a distinct genus, but rather a species of Diplodocus."Camptosaurus,,,,,,,This dinosaur is mentioned by Tim saying that there was a skeleton in a museum he visited with his family.Deinonychus,,,,,,,"This dinosaur is mentioned by Tim, then Grant told him that it was reclassified as a species of Velociraptor."Tenontosaurus,,,,,,,Mentioned by Tim as a prey item for Deinonychus (told by Grant that Deinonychus was reclassified as a Velociraptor).Euoplocephalus,,,,,,,Seen on the population count.Styracosaurus,,,,,,,Seen on the population count.Troodon,,,,,,,"Levine mentions a Troodon (as ""Stenonychosaurus"") skeleton found by a colleague."Edmontosaurus,,,,,,,A skull thought to belong to Edmontosaurus annectens (previouslyAnatotitan annectens) can be seen in the Tyrannosaurus rex nest in the second film.
